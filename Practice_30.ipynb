    "# A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). \n",
    "# The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. \n",
    "# The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:\n",
    "# UP 5\n",
    "# DOWN 3\n",
    "# LEFT 3\n",
    "# RIGHT 2\n",
    "# ¡\n",
    "# The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance \n",
    "# from current position after a sequence of movement and original point.\n",
    "# If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# If the following tuples are given as input to the program:\n",
    "# UP 5\n",
    "# DOWN 3\n",
    "# LEFT 3\n",
    "# RIGHT 2\n",
